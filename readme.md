### Purpose

Simple demonstration of calling an API using jQuery and displaying the results on a web page in this example I've used github and requested it's top level api response which is a list of endpoints


### Setup

You don't need to set anything up, you can view this prototype live at [CSR-Genesis on gh-pages](https://codeforaustralia.github.io/CSR-Genesis/CSR-Genesis.html).

If you want to run it locally then simply clone this repo with ```git clone https://github.com/CodeforAustralia/CSR-Genesis.git```
